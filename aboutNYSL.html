                        Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a
                        member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside
                        neighborhood. NYSL is ran by small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer
                        time of
                        parents and previous league members.</blockquote>
